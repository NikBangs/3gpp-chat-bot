  "what is 3gpp?": "3GPP stands for 3rd Generation Partnership Project. It is a collaboration between various standardization organizations to develop specifications for mobile telecommunications systems.",
  "explain handover in urllc": "Handover in URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication) refers to the process of transferring a communication session from one radio access technology (RAT) to another, such as from LTE to GSM or UMTS. This is important for ensuring seamless connectivity and maintaining communication quality, especially in scenarios where reliability and low latency are critical, as in URLLC applications. The handover process involves the UE (User Equipment) switching between different networks while maintaining the ongoing communication session.",
  "how does 5g slicing work?": "5G slicing works by allowing network operators to create multiple virtual networks within a single physical network infrastructure. Each slice is tailored to specific requirements such as bandwidth, latency, security, and services. This enables efficient resource allocation and customization of network services based on the needs of different applications or users.",
  "how is handling of group specific session management congestion control difference in both releases?": "The handling of group specific session management congestion control differs between releases based on the network's detection and initiation of APN-based congestion control when specific criteria are met, such as storing APN congestion back-off times per UE and congested APN. The network may use the congested APN if the UE does not provide an APN for a non-emergency PDN connection.",
  "compare ims registration status?": "The technical documentation outlines different procedures that the UE (User Equipment) must follow based on its mode of operation when there is a change in IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) registration status. The UE needs to execute specific procedures outlined in tables 4.3.2.4.1, 4.3.2.4.2, or 4.3.2.4.3 depending on whether it is operating in PS mode 1, PS mode 2, CS/PS mode 1, or CS/PS mode 2. The changes in IMS registration status trigger different actions that the UE must take to ensure proper operation in the network.",
  "what are the new features in release 17?": "The new features in Release 17 include enhancements to UE additional security capability information element structure, EPS attach result information element coding, EPS attach type information element coding and type, and EPS mobile identity and network feature support information elements. These enhancements aim to improve security algorithms support, attach procedure result specification, attach type indication, and mobile identity provision within the EPS network.",
  "what are the new features in release 17 in a little more detail": "The new features in release 17 include the addition of UE additional security capability information element for supporting security algorithms in S1 mode with NR, EPS attach result information element for specifying attach procedure results, EPS attach type information element for indicating attach type, and EPS mobile identity information element for providing IMSI, GUTI, or IMEI. These elements are structured and coded as detailed in the technical documentation.",
  "explain eps attach type information element coding and type": "The EPS attach type information element indicates the type of attach requested. It is coded as per the specifications in figure 9.9.3.11.1 and table 9.9.3.11.1. It is classified as a type 1 information element. For further details, refer to clause 10.5.3.2.2 in 3GPP TS 24.008.\n\nSimilarly, the EPS attach result information element specifies the result of an attach procedure. It is coded according to figure 9.9.3.10.1 and table 9.9.3.10.1, also classified as a type 1 information element.\n\nAdditionally, the EPS mobile identity information element provides IMSI, GUTI, or IMEI. It is coded as shown in figures 9.9.3.12.1 and 9.9.3.12.2 and table 9.9.3.12.1. This element is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum length of 13 octets.\n\nLastly, the EPS update result information element specifies the result of the associated updating procedure. It is coded as per figure 9.9.3.13.1 and table 9.9.3.13.1, also classified as a type 1 information element."
